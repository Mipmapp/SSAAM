# SSAAM - Student School Activities Attendance Monitoring

## Overview
SSAAM is a Vue 3 + Vite frontend application designed for monitoring student attendance at school activities. This Single Page Application (SPA) integrates with a backend API to provide dual-role authentication (Students and Masters/Teachers), comprehensive student data management with CRUD operations, and features like RFID code support for attendance. The project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure system for schools to track student engagement in activities efficiently, addressing performance concerns with large datasets through optimized pagination and server-side filtering.

## User Preferences
- I want iterative development.
- Ask before making major changes.
- I prefer detailed explanations.
- Do not make changes to the folder `Z`.
- Do not make changes to the file `Y`.
- I prefer simple language.
- I like functional programming.

## System Architecture
The application is a Vue 3 SPA utilizing the Composition API and Vite 5 for a modern frontend build. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, and routing by Vue Router 4.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Professional SVG icon system.
- Mobile-first design with a smooth animated hamburger menu.
- Custom scrollbar styling (purple/pink gradient) for aesthetic consistency.
- Notifications display links with a purple-to-pink gradient.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Authentication:** Dual-role (Students by numeric ID, Masters/Teachers by letter-starting ID) with API-based Bearer token. Encrypted timestamp authentication with XOR+Base64 encoding for all protected API calls, including anti-bot protection (User-Agent validation, bot pattern detection, rate limiting) for registration.
- **Student Management:**
    - Admin/Master dashboard with full CRUD for student records.
    - Search/filter functionality with pagination (10-20 students per page).
    - Student names are automatically converted to uppercase.
    - Student ID validation restricts IDs to `21-A-XXXXX` through `25-A-XXXXX`.
    - Admin-only access for edit/delete student operations.
- **Attendance:** RFID code support for attendance. Students receive email notifications upon RFID verification.
- **Dashboard Statistics:** Displays aggregate student statistics by program and year level, fetched from a dedicated, non-paginated endpoint for complete data.
- **Image Management:** Integrates with ImgBB for image uploads. For notifications, users can upload images directly (click-to-upload interface) which are automatically sent to ImgBB via the backend API. The backend handles the ImgBB upload and returns the hosted URL.
- **Form Validation:** Advanced validation with custom error messages (e.g., Student ID format `12-A-12345`, Unicode support for names).
- **Notifications System:** Role-based notifications (Admin/MedPub) with fields for title, message, priority, and tracking `posted_by`, `posted_by_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `was_edited` status. Users can "heart" (like) announcements - liked state persists and shows like count.
- **Password Reset:** Three-step email-based password reset with rate limiting, hashed codes, enumeration prevention, and atomic operations. Frontend includes "Forgot Password?" link on login page with full reset flow UI.
- **Admin Settings:** A settings page allows Admins/Masters to toggle user registration and student login, displaying custom messages when features are disabled. Settings are stored in MongoDB.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Efficient Pagination:** Frontend displays only the current page (10-20 students). Statistics are fetched separately to ensure complete dashboard data without performance overhead. All search and filtering operations are performed server-side.
- **Security:** Robust validation and anti-bot measures are implemented, including timestamp-based authentication for API calls.
- **API Integration:** Designed to work with `https://ssaam-api.vercel.app` for all data operations.

## External Dependencies
